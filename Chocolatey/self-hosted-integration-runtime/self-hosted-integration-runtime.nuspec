    <summary>The latest version of Integration Runtime</summary>
    <description>The latest version of Integration Runtime at build time.

      #### Supported Operating System

      Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022
      Download and run the IntergrationRuntime.msi (64-bit) to install the Integration Runtime on your computer

      Installation of the self-hosted integration runtime on a domain controller isn't supported.

      Self-hosted integration runtime requires a 64-bit Operating System with .NET Framework 4.7.2 or above. See .NET Framework System Requirements for details.
      The recommended minimum configuration for the self-hosted integration runtime machine is a 2-GHz processor with 4 cores, 8 GB of RAM, and 80 GB of available hard drive space

      #### Uninstalling
      Uninstalling with Chocolatey is known to not be reliable, as the uninstaller wants to locate `sql_engine_core_inst_loc.msi` from the original installation media.

      Should you need to uninstall this cumulative update, you may need to revert to manual uninstallation via Programs and Features, Installed Updates.
